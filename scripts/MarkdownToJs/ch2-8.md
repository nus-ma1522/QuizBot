## Checkpoint1 Determinant by Cofactor Expansion

### plain

Now that we have learnt all the FUN things about inverse matrices and LU factorisation, let's move on to <b>determinants</b>!!

Before diving into formulas, let's try to understand what a determinant actually means.

### plain

Think of the determinant as a single number that you can calculate from a square matrix. This one number gives you a ton of secret information about the matrix itself! It's like a magic summary.

So, what secrets does it reveal? As we go on, we'll discover exactly what the determinant can tell us!

### plain

In this chapter, we will take a look at the first of 2 ways to calculate a discriminant:

<b>1. Determinant by Cofactor Expansion</b> 2. Determinant by Reduction

Let's take a look at the first one, calculating the Determinant by Cofactor Expansion!!

### plain

Let's start off with the easiest case!

If $n = 1$, then the determinant of a $1 \times 1$ matrix $\mathbf{A} = (a)$ is simply defined as:
$$\det(\mathbf{A}) = a$$

### mcq

Using the above definition, what is the determinant of this $1 \times 1$ matrix $$\mathbf{A} = (1)$$

- $\det(\mathbf{A}) = 1$

* $\det(\mathbf{A}) = 0$
* Can't be determined!

### plain

The determinant is just the number inside, which is $1$!

### plain

So what happens if $n > 1$? Now it's not so simple right?

Mathematicians came up with <b>cofactor expansion</b> and we will be using it to calculate our determinant!

### tex

The determinant¬†of $\mathbf{A}$ for an order $n$ square matrix¬†is defined to be

$$
\begin{align}
\det(\mathbf{A})&=a_{i1}A_{i1}+a_{i2}A_{i2}+\cdots+a_{in}A_{in}=\sum_{k=1}^na_{ik}A_{ik}\quad \quad \\
&=a_{1j}A_{1j}+a_{2j}A_{2j}+\cdots+a_{nj}A_{nj}=\sum_{k=1}^na_{kj}A_{kj}\quad \quad
\end{align}$$where¬†
$$A_{ij}=(-1)^{i+j}\det(\mathbf{M}_{ij})$$
is the $(i,j)$ cofactor of $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}_{ij}$, the $(i,j)$¬†matrix minor¬†of $\mathbf{A}$, obtained from $\mathbf{A}$ by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.

This is called the cofactor expansion along


$$

\begin{cases}
\text{row } i & (1) \\[6pt]
\text{column } j & (2)
\end{cases}

OK, LET'S STOP HERE! All these math notations are making me DIZZY üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´!

Let's go through what the above is saying with an example:
$$\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$$Pick any row or column to expand along. Feel free to pick whichever you like, no right or wrong answers!

- First row ($R_1$)
    - expand_r1_1
- Second row ($R_2$)
    - expand_r2_1
- First column ($C_1$)
    - expand_c1_1
- Second column ($C_2$)
    - expand_c2_1

### plain expand_r1_1
Expanding along the <b>first row</b>:

Going from left to right of $R_1$, we first focus on the entry $a$ at position $(1,1)$.

### mcq expand_r1_2
<b>Step 1:</b> Find the $(1, 1)$ matrix minor of $\mathbf{A}$.
$$

\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\quad
\text{Remove row 1, Remove column 1}
$$Since we are finding the matrix minor at $(1, 1)$, we remove row 1 and column 1. The remaining elements form a 'sub-matrix', which is the <b>matrix minor</b>! What is the resulting matrix?

- $(a)$
- $(b)$
- $(c)$

* $(d)$

### plain expand_r1_3

After removing $R_1$ and $C_1$, all that's left is $d$! So the matrix minor will be $(d)$!

### mcq expand_r1_4

<b>Step 2:</b> Find the determinant of the matrix minor above.

- $a$
- $b$
- $c$

* $d$

### plain expand_r1_5

Determinant of matrix minor $(d)$ is just the entry inside. Hence, $\det((d)) = d$.

### mcq expand_r1_6

<b>Step 3:</b> Find cofactor $A_{11}$ by applying appropriate signs to the determinant you found above.

Here's a visualization of how the signs should be assigned in a $2 \times 2$ matrix:
$$\begin{pmatrix} {+} & {-} \\ {-} & {+} \\ \end{pmatrix}$$
As you can tell, it follows a checkerboard pattern!
So what is the cofactor $A_{11}$?

<em>Hint: Apply the sign at $(1, 1)$</em>

- $d$

* $-d$
* $c$
* $-c$

### plain expand_r1_7

We simply apply the $+$ sign at $(1, 1)$ to $d$, which still gives me $d$.

### mcq expand_r1_8

<b>Step 4:</b> Multiply the cofactor $A_{11}$ that you found above by $a_{11}$, the entry that we are 'operating on'.

- $-ad$

* $ad$

- $ac$
- $-ac$

### plain expand_r1_9

We have found that:
$$\begin{align*}a_{11} = a \\ A_{11} = d\end{align*}$$Therefore, $a_{11} A_{11} = ad$.

### plain expand_r1_10

Now that we are done with $a_{11}$, let‚Äôs move to the next entry in $R_1$: $a_{12}$.

### mcq expand_r1_11

Now repeat steps 1-4, what is the value of $a_{12} A_{12}$?
$$\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$$

- $-bc$

* $bc$
* $-bd$
* $bd$

### plain expand_r1_12

Let's run through the steps quickly!

<b>Step 1:</b> $(1, 2)$ matrix minor of $\mathbf{A}$: $(c)$ (Remove Row 1 and Column 2)
<b>Step 2:</b> $\det((c)) = c$
<b>Step 3:</b> $A_{12} = -c$ (Applying checkerboard of signs)
<b>Step 4:</b> $a_{12} A_{12} = -bc$

### mcq expand_r1_13

Now that we have found:
$$\begin{align*}a_{11} A_{11} &= ad \\a_{12} A_{12} &= -bc\end{align*}$$Finally, what cofactor expansion says is that $\det(\mathbf{A}) =$ <b>Sum of products between each entry and its cofactor along a row or column</b>.

In this case (Expanding along $R_1$): $\det(\mathbf{A}) =a_{11} A_{11} + a_{12} A_{12}$.
$$\det(\mathbf{A}) = \space??$$

- $ab - cd$
- $ad + bc$
- $ac - bd$

* $ad - bc$

### plain
We saw how cofactor expansion works on a $2 \times 2$ matrix. What about a  matrix with size $n > 2$?

### plain
The procedure remains <b>exactly the same</b>, just more numbers to calculate now!!
Let's try it with an example!
$$\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 0 & 6 \end{pmatrix}$$ You can choose any row/column but for this exercise, but let's just expand along R1!

### mcq
<b>Step 1:</b> Starting from the first entry $A_{11}$, find the $(1,1)$ matrix minor of $\mathbf{A}$.
<em>Hint: Remove row 1, column 1</em>
- $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 4 \\ 5 & 6\end{pmatrix}$
- $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 3 \\ 5 & 0\end{pmatrix}$
* $\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\ 0 & 6\end{pmatrix}$
- $\begin{pmatrix}2 & 0 \\ 0 & 6\end{pmatrix}$

### mcq
<b>Step 2:</b> Find the cofactor $A_{11}$.
Checkerboard:
$$\begin{pmatrix} {+} & {-} & {+} \\ {-} & {+} & {-} \\ {+} & {-} & {+} \end{pmatrix}$$
* $18$
- $-18$
- $12$
- $-12$

### plain
$\left| \begin{matrix} 3 & 4 \\ 0 & 6 \end{matrix} \right| = 18$

### mcq
What is $a_{11}A_{11} =$ ?
- $-18$
- $10$
- $5$
* $18$


### plain
Entry $a_{11} = 1$
Cofactor $A_{11} = 18$
$a_{11}A_{11} = 18$

### mcq
Continue the procedure for the rest of the entries in $R_1$ by yourself.
What is $\det(\mathbf{A}) =$ ?
$$\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 0 & 6 \end{pmatrix}$$
- $18$
- $40$
* $58$
- $-58$

### plain
$\det(\mathbf{A}) = 1\left| \begin{matrix} 3 & 4 \\ 0 & 6 \end{matrix}\right|$ $- \space2\left| \begin{matrix} 0 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 \end{matrix} \right|$ $+ \space0\left| \begin{matrix} 0 & 3 \\ 5 & 0 \end{matrix} \right| = 58$
In case you are wondering, the determinant of $2\times2$ matrix can be quickly calculated with what we found earlier: $ad-bc$

### mcq
Let's try another example:
$$\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} 54 & 3 & 0 \\ 9 & 5 & 0 \\ 4 & -19 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$Find $|A|$.

- -5

- It's too big, I gotta matlab it...

### plain
Remember how we are free to choose any row/column to expand along? Simply choose $C_3$ to do my cofactor expansion and I quickly find that $\det(\mathbf{A}) = 0$!
In cofactor expansion, <b>always choose the row/column that makes your life the easiest!</b>

### mcq
Now you are given a triangular matrix, select an appropriate row/column and find $$\left| \begin{matrix} a & b & c \\ 0 & d & e \\ 0 & 0 & f \end{matrix}\right|$$
- $0$
* $adf$
- $aei - afh - bdi + bfg + cdh - ceg$
- I have no clue!!

### plain
Cofactor Expansion along C1:
$\left| \begin{matrix} a & b & c \\ 0 & d & e \\ 0 & 0 & f \end{matrix}\right| = a\left| \begin{matrix} d & e \\ 0 & f \end{matrix}\right| = a(df - 0) = adf$
Realise that $a, d, f$ are the diagonal entries of the matrix!

### tex
In fact, the determinant of any triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries. That is, if  $\mathbf{A}$ is triangular, then

$$\det(\mathbf{A}) = a_{11} a_{22} \ldots a_{nn} = \prod_{k=1}^{n} a_{kk}.$$

### plain
Does this result work for a lower triangular matrix? Convince yourself by working it out manually!

That's it!! You have learnt <b>cofactor expansion</b>, the first of the two main ways to find a determinant!
